Hi My name is Carlos Palacios, i just finished my bachelor's degree in International Business Management at the HEG and i specialized in Commodity trading. I had a class during my last year about Python with Jupiter notebook and machine learning, and i believe this course will give me a greater understanding of data analysis programming that i could later use in my career.
